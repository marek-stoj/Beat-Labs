# Beat-Labs

Hi there! I've decided to let go of Beat Labs. Worry not though as I'm still planning to work on it 😉 I've just finally reaalized that by myself I won't be able to implement even a fraction of what I would like to 😅

So, first things first - there's already a version 0.2 of Beat Labs on SideQuest (https://sidequestvr.com/app/3832/beat-labs) It's not much but hey - you gotta start somewhere 😀

Second - I want to make Beat Labs open-source but there is a slight issue. I've used a bunch of paid Assets from Unity Asset Store so I can't just make everything public. I'll probably publish the code that I wrote and put out links to the Assets so that if anybody truly wants to work on it, they might purchase those assets themselves.. Actually, do let me know if you're really interested in taking a look at the project and can't afford the assets. I might just buy seat licenses for you! 🤘

And the last thing. I've been collecting some "brain dumps" as I call them over the last couple of months. They all somehow revolve around Beat Labs. I no longer believe it's necessarry to hoard them. Go check them out if you want to, pick my brain, get inspired, get creative!
